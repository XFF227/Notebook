“Vlasschaert et al. A practical approach to curate clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in human genetic data sets”
- variants: 74 CHIP genes
- filtering: depth >=20, minAD>=3, F1R2, F2R1>=1, VAF>=2%
- TERT and age removal
- binomial neal 50% removal
- minAD>=5 for UKB, >=3 for AOU
totally remove 16 CHIP genes

### 04
“Analysis of 10,478 cancer genomes identifies candidate driver genes and opportunities for precision oncology“
- dN/dS----driver genes
- COSMIC, intOGen TCGA databases test driver genes
- Clinical Actionability/Tumor-agnostic Biomarkers/Druggable Genome

2019 Science Review: *Clonal Hematopoiesis in Human Aging and Disease*  
1. Hematopoietic stem cells acquire **driver** mutations → CHIP, VAF ≥ 2%.  
2. Elevated risk of hematologic cancers **(possibly due to mutations in cancer-related genes?)**g g
3. Cardiovascular disease **(why?)**

2022 Nature Study: UK Biobank GWAS of CHIP  
1. GWAS and ExWAS.  
2. Not a single phenotype—multiple heterogeneous subtypes across different CHIP mutations.  
3. Different mutation types show distinct behavior; for example, **DNMT3A-type** CHIP tends to progress to myeloid leukemias such as AML.

### 10
2023 Clinical Cancer Research Review: Relationship between CHIP and Solid Tumors  
1. CHIP is restricted to asymptomatic individuals without a hematologic diagnosis.  
2. CHIP → clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS) → overt malignancy.

### 11
1. How does paired-end short-read sequencing work?What are its strengths and limitations 
- sequencing from both end
- more sensitive
- expensive
2. Mutation types and how they can affect a protein (missense, loss of function etc.)
- missense: differen protein
- frameshift: loss of function
- nonsense: stop early
- silent: no effect
3. Germline vs somatic variants
- Germline: froma parent, 50%
- somaric: not be inherited
4. **What is clonal hematopoiesis?Why does it happen?**
- some driver mutation brings Proliferation advantage
- stem cell has mutation to grow in larger number
- mutated stem cell produce more mutated stem cell 
5. What is clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential?How does it differ from regular clonal hematopoiesis 
- without diagonosis

6. What are cancer driver mutations?How do we find them? 
- mutation make cell have Proliferation advantage
- high frequency in cancer; prediction protein function; pathway analyze (mutual exclusivity); evolution?
7. What is a passenger mutation?
- no effect, random mutation
- uniform distribution
8. The genome sequencing bioinformatics workflow – major steps 
- FASTAQ--QC---alignment with ref---bim---variant calling---vcf---annotation
9. What are the factors affecting variant call quality?
- coverage, 
11. Differences in calling germline vs. somatic variants (bioinformatics)

### 21
1. Back to mutation types: what do you think are the most damaging mutation types? Least damaging? Rank the mutation types from before in order of how damaging they would be to a protein.
- insertion/deletion(frameshift) > nonsense > missense > slient
2. When we are trying to find mutations that are pathogenic, we often will look for mutations that are rare in a population database (like gnomAD) – why do we do this? Why is a rare mutation much more likely to be disease-causing than one that is very common?
- Most people don't have disease. If a mutation will cause serious disease, people have this mutation are more likely to die so the freq in database will be low.
3. Familiarize yourself with the hematopoietic hierarchy – what kind of cells can a hematopoietic stem cell generate?
- Hematopoietic Stem Cells: top
- Common Myeloid Progenitors: blood cell
- Common Lymphoid Progenitors: B, T
4. From the paper above, describe other forms of clonal hematopoiesis that are not CHIP.
- Chromosomal alterations
- Loss of chromosomal
- cancer
5. What are some ways that CHIP mutations affect hematopoietic cell phenotype?
- 
6. Based on the answer to number 5 (and the Cell Reports paper I sent you before), how do you think CHIP can affect cancer cells in other tissues?
