“Vlasschaert et al. A practical approach to curate clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in human genetic data sets”
- variants: 74 CHIP genes
- filtering: depth >=20, minAD>=3, F1R2, F2R1>=1, VAF>=2%
- TERT and age removal
- binomial neal 50% removal
- minAD>=5 for UKB, >=3 for AOU
totally remove 16 CHIP genes

### 04
“Analysis of 10,478 cancer genomes identifies candidate driver genes and opportunities for precision oncology“
- dN/dS----driver genes
- COSMIC, intOGen TCGA databases test driver genes
- Clinical Actionability/Tumor-agnostic Biomarkers/Druggable Genome

2019 Science Review: *Clonal Hematopoiesis in Human Aging and Disease*  
1. Hematopoietic stem cells acquire **driver** mutations → CHIP, VAF ≥ 2%.  
2. Elevated risk of hematologic cancers **(possibly due to mutations in cancer-related genes?)**g g
3. Cardiovascular disease **(why?)**

2022 Nature Study: UK Biobank GWAS of CHIP  
1. GWAS and ExWAS.  
2. Not a single phenotype—multiple heterogeneous subtypes across different CHIP mutations.  
3. Different mutation types show distinct behavior; for example, **DNMT3A-type** CHIP tends to progress to myeloid leukemias such as AML.

### 10
2023 Clinical Cancer Research Review: Relationship between CHIP and Solid Tumors  
1. CHIP is restricted to asymptomatic individuals without a hematologic diagnosis.  
2. CHIP → clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS) → overt malignancy.

- How does paired-end short-read sequencing work?What are its strengths and limitations 
sequencing from both end
more sensitive
expensive
- Mutation types and how they can affect a protein (missense, loss of function etc.)
missense: differen protein
frameshift: loss of function
nonsense: stop early
silent: no effect
- Germline vs somatic variants
Germline: froma parent, 50%
somaric: not be inherited
- **What is clonal hematopoiesis?Why does it happen?**
some driver mutation brings Proliferation advantage
stem cell has mutation to grow in larger number
mutated stem cell produce more mutated stem cell 
- What is clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential?How does it differ from regular clonal hematopoiesis 
without diagonosis

- What are cancer driver mutations?How do we find them? 
mutation make cell have Proliferation advantage
high frequency in cancer; prediction protein function; pathway analyze (mutual exclusivity); evolution?
- What is a passenger mutation?
no effect, random mutation
uniform distribution
- The genome sequencing bioinformatics workflow – major steps 
FASTAQ--QC---alignment with ref---bim---variant calling---vcf---annotation
- What are the factors affecting variant call quality?
coverage, 
Differences in calling germline vs. somatic variants (bioinformatics)
