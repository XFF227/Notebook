“Vlasschaert et al. A practical approach to curate clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in human genetic data sets”
- variants: 74 CHIP genes
- filtering: depth >=20, minAD>=3, F1R2, F2R1>=1, VAF>=2%
- TERT and age removal
- binomial neal 50% removal
- minAD>=5 for UKB, >=3 for AOU
totally remove 16 CHIP genes

### 04
“Analysis of 10,478 cancer genomes identifies candidate driver genes and opportunities for precision oncology“
- dN/dS----driver genes
- COSMIC, intOGen TCGA databases test driver genes
- Clinical Actionability/Tumor-agnostic Biomarkers/Druggable Genome

2019 Science Review: *Clonal Hematopoiesis in Human Aging and Disease*  
1. Hematopoietic stem cells acquire **driver** mutations → CHIP, VAF ≥ 2%.  
2. Elevated risk of hematologic cancers <span style="color:red">(possibly due to mutations in cancer-related genes?)</span>  
3. Cardiovascular disease <span style="color:red">(why?)</span>

### 2022 Nature Study: UK Biobank GWAS of CHIP  
1. GWAS and ExWAS.  
2. Not a single phenotype—multiple heterogeneous subtypes across different CHIP mutations.  
3. Different mutation types show distinct behavior; for example, **DNMT3A-type** CHIP tends to progress to myeloid leukemias such as AML.

### 2023 Clinical Cancer Research Review: Relationship between CHIP and Solid Tumors  
1. CHIP is restricted to asymptomatic individuals without a hematologic diagnosis.  
2. CHIP → **clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS)** → overt malignancy.
